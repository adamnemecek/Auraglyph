# Auragraph
Auraglyph is an infinite modular musical sketchpad

Auraglyph is an audio software programming, composition, and design system for iPad in which processing structures are created with stylus and multitouch input. Via stylus input, users draw a variety of audio and control nodes and the interconnections between them. These nodes are further parameterized by modal handwritten input, from simple numerals to time- and frequency-domain signals. Machine learning-based handwriting recognition is used to analyze the userâ€™s stylus strokes, affording a rich vocabulary of symbolic input. Additional nodes are available for creating conventional input/output interfaces, such as on-screen knobs and sliders and MIDI I/O.
