% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement

% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of

%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the

\begin{abstract}
This paper provides a sample of a \LaTeX\ document for the NIME conference series. It conforms,
somewhat loosely, to the formatting guidelines for
ACM SIG Proceedings. It is an {\em alternate} style which produces
a {\em tighter-looking} paper and was designed in response to
concerns expressed, by authors, over page-budgets.
It complements the document \textit{Author's (Alternate) Guide to
Preparing ACM SIG Proceedings Using \LaTeX$2_\epsilon$\ and Bib\TeX}.
This source file has been written with the intention of being
compiled under \LaTeX$2_\epsilon$\ and BibTeX.

To make best use of this sample document, run it through \LaTeX\
and BibTeX, and compare this source code with your compiled PDF file. A compiled PDF version is available to help you with the `look and feel.'

The abstract should preferably be between 100 and 200 words.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

Touch-based computing has profoundly altered the landscape of mainstream computing in the early 21st century. 
Since the introduction of the iPhone in 2007, and later the iPad in 2010, scores of touchscreen devices have entered the popular consciousness, from mobile phones, tablet computers, watches, and desktop computer screens, to name a few. 
New human-computer interaction paradigms have accompanied these hardware developments, addressing the complex shift from classical keyboard-and-pointer computing to multitouch interaction. 
We propose a new model for touchscreen interaction with musical systems: the combined use of stylus-based handwriting input and direct touch manipulation. 
This system provides a number of advantages over existing touchscreen paradigms for music. 
Stylus input, complemented by machine learning-based handwriting recognition, provides a number of advantages in this scheme. 
Firstly, it replaces the traditional role of keyboard-based text/numeric entry with handwritten letters and numerals.
It additionally allows for modal entry of generic shapes and glyphs, for example, canonical oscillator patterns (sine wave, sawtooth wave, square wave, etc.) or other abstract symbols.
Finally, the stylus provides precise graphical free-form input for e.g. filter transfer functions, envelopes, and parameter automation curves. 
Multitouch finger input continues to provide functionality that has become expected of touch-based software, such as direct movement of on-screen objects, interaction with conventional controls (sliders, buttons, etc.), and other graphical manipulations. 
In this paper we discuss the design, prototyping, and evaluation of one implementation of such a system, which we have titled ``Auraglyph.''

\section{Interacting with Auraglyph}
\label{sec:SystemDescription}

As a framework to prototype and evaluate many of the concepts discussed above, as well as for   use in composition and sound design, we have developed a software application for iPad called Auraglyph. 
A user interacts with Auraglyph using an iPad-compatible stylus, many models of which are widely available, and with traditional touch interaction. 

The basic environment of Auraglyph is an open, scrollable canvas in which the user freely draws. 
Using a variety of pen strokes, a user creates interactive objects (such as unit generators, control rate processors, and input/output controls), sets parameters of these objects, and forms connections between them, collectively comprising a \emph{patch}. 
After a user completes a pen stroke (a single contour between touching the pen to the screen and lifting it off the screen), this stroke is matched against the set of base object glyphs available in the main canvas, via a machine learning-based handwriting recognizer (discussed in Section \ref{sec:HandwritingRecognition}). 
The main canvas objects whose glyphs can be matched include an audio rate processor (unit generator), control rate processor, input, or output (see Section \ref{sec:BaseGlyphs}). 
If the stroke matches an available glyph, the user's stroke is replaced by the actual object. 
Unmatched strokes remain on the canvas, allowing the user to embellish the canvas with freehand drawings. 

Tapping and holding an object will open up a list of parameters for that object. 
Selecting a parameter from this list opens a control into which writing a number will set the value. 
This value can then be accepted or discarded, or the user can cancel setting the parameter. 

Every base object may have an input node, an output node, or both, visualized by small circles on the perimeter of the object. 
Tapping a node will highlight it, and by drawing a stroke from an input node to an output node, or vice-versa, the user forms a connection between those two objects. 
Most objects only have one output source, but an object input node may have several destinations with that object (e.g. frequency, amplitude, or phase of a given oscillator). 
In such cases, a pop-up menu appears from the input node to display the options a user may have for input destination. 

Objects and drawings can be moved around on the canvas by touching and dragging them, a familiar gesture in the touchscreen software ecosystem. 
While dragging an object, moving the pen over a delete icon in the corner of the screen will remove that object, along with destroying any connections between it and other objects. 
Connections can be removed by grabbing them with a touch and then dragging them until they ``break."

\subsection{Base Objects}
\label{sec:BaseGlyphs}

Four base objects comprise the set of objects that can be drawn to the main canvas: audio-rate processors (unit generators; represented by a circle), control-rate processors (represented by a square), inputs (a downward-pointing triangle), and outputs (an upward triangle). 
Unit generators currently available include basic oscillators (sine, sawtooth, square, and triangle waves, plus hand-drawn wavetables), envelopes (linear and ADSR), filters (resonant low-pass/high-pass/band-pass, hand-drawn transfer function), and a reverberator. 
Control-rate processors include timers, discrete time-step sequencers, and hand-drawn parameter control curves. 
Inputs consist of on-screen keyboard controllers, graphical sliders, and buttons. 
Outputs comprise of numeric displays and binary ``LED'' indicators.  

\section{Handwriting Recognition}
\label{sec:HandwritingRecognition}

The concepts presented herein are generally invariant to the underlying algorithms and framework for handwriting recognition, but these topics merit discussion with regards to our own implementation in Auraglyph. 
The underlying handwriting recognition engine of Auraglyph is LipiTk \cite{madhvanath2007lipitk}, a comprehensive open-source project for handwriting recognition research. 
The default configuration of LipiTk uses dynamic time warping (DTW) \cite{niels2005using} and nearest-neighbor (k-NN) to match strokes to a pre-existing database of possible characters.  
We have found the speed and accuracy of
